# Sift-Implementation

This is the final code we used for our project.  Our results for the sift detection algorithm are in this repository and if you would like to run this code make sure it is in the same directory as the Data_Set Repository.

To run decode just run at the main.P why file.  If you would like to change the image change the path location in the __name__==’main’ function.
The GenerateDatabaseInfo.py file is meant to create the database of model keypoints and should not neeed to be run.

The results folder contains the results of our experimentation.
